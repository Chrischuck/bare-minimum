Written using react, webpack 2, preact, and love!

A progressive web app designed to help other college students get through college. Eventually we want to add donations(for charities!) as well as a few other cool features such as a word count to page length calculator or even a plagiarism checker! But for now, we're just working on better grade calculators and a gpa calculator.

## Goals
- [ ] Get rid of all unused CSS
- [ ] Replace React Router w/ smaller or custom library
- [ ] Replace Sweetalert w/ custom modals
- [ ] Increase performance/load times
- [ ] Fix ui font issues, make it look better

If you want to help out, just clone and do a little npm install and you're on your way!
