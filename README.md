ðŸš€ 100% on Lighthouse! ðŸš€

Written using react, webpack 2, preact, and love!

A progressive web app designed to help other college students get through college. Eventually we want to add donations(for charities!) as well as a few other cool features such as a word count to page length calculator or even a plagiarism checker! But for now, we're just working on better grade calculators and a gpa calculator.

## Goals
- [ ] Get rid of all unused CSS
- [ ] Replace React Router w/ smaller or custom library
- [ ] Increase performance/load times
- [ ] Fix ui font issues, make it look better

## Installation
If you want to help out, just clone and npm install(or yarn!) and you're on your way!  

To get the webpack dev server running:  
```bash
npm run dev
```
In order to emulate production:
```bash
npm run build
```  
and then
```bash
npm run start
```
