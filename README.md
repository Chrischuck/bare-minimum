A progressive web app designed to help other college students get through college. Eventually we want to add donations(for charities!) as well as a few other cool features such as a word count to page length calculator or even a plagiarism checker! But for now, we're just working on better grade calculators and a gpa calculator.

Things to do: Upgrade to webpack 2, purify css, better ui (material design??)!

If you want to help out, just clone and do a little npm install and you're on your way!
